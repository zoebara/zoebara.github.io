## Welcome to Zoe Bara's Website and Online Portfolio!

#### As of April 10th, 2019, this website is a new project for me that I hope will develop in programming complexity as I learn and apply more with WebDev. Here are some content things that you should hopefully see soon on this webpage: 
- Educational Background
- Job Experience 
- Career Goals and Ideals
- Ongoing Projects
- Contact Information
- Possibly a Blog
- and more!

#### Please be mindful that I am a full-time student and that this is a side-project for me at the moment. I hope to work on this as much as I can, but it will always be a work in progress. Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or concerns that you may have regarding this site.
